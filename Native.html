                <p>The Gray Catbird is a member of the family Mimidae, and can be commonly mistaken
                    for the Dark-Eyed Junco, another gray bird found in the city. However, the Gray Catbird is
                    distinctly
                    larger. The Catbird is solid gray with in both its body and wings, with a distinct black cap,
                    usually
                    the key signifier in its identification, except for a russet patch under its long tail. While it may
                    be
                    difficult to spot it along the dirt and branches, they pop out against the bright foliage and
                    leaves.
                    Catbirds reside in New York City all year, and are not very shy around people, though are more
                    reserved
                    than starlings and sparrows. They are easily found wooded areas of Central Park, with many sightings
                    in
                    the Halett Nature Sanctuary and the Ramble.</p>

                <h3>Hover To Hear</h3>
                <p>The Gray Catbird was named for the sound of its call, which is distinctly
                    shrill and sounds eerily alike to a cat's meow. Like the other members of the Mimidae family,
                    Catbirds
                    are capable of mimicking the calls of other birds, and even other animals.

                <p>The iconic Blue Jay is widely known for its bright blue feathers and distinct, tufty head. Belonging
                    to the family Corvidae alongside the Common Raven and American Crow, it stands out from its close
                    relatives due to its vivid display. The Blue Jay can be found all throughout the city, as these bold
                    birds are less afraid of humans than most, and are even less afraid of other birds and animals. Its
                    territorial behavior and ability to mimic other predators gives the Blue Jay an edge against other
                    birds.</p>

                <p>The Northern Cardinal is one, if not, the most iconic bird in the East Coast. It's easy to take
                    this
                    bright red bird for granted when you travel elsewhere and can't find any local birds that can
                    live
                    up to the same standards. It might even be hard to believe that such an iconic bird actually
                    exists!
                    The Northern
                    Cardinal belongs to the Cardinalidae family, related to Tanagers, Grosbeaks, and the
                    unfortunately
                    named Dickcissel. Male Northern Cardinals are bright red with a black mask and orange beak,
                    while
                    female Cardinals are more muted: brown with tinges of red around its tufted head, wing, and tail
                    tips.

                <p>Northern Cardinals are known for their sharp chirps that sound more puckered than sparrows.
                    Cardinals
                    are known for being very territorial, so it's not unusual to hear entourages of such chirps when
                    walking around the woods and forest floor. </p>

                <p>The "all-American" Robin was actually named by European colonizers due to its similar appearance
                    to
                    the European Robin. Though, the American Robin is larger and is classified as a completely
                    different
                    type of bird, the thrush, while its European "counterpart" is a flycatcher. Belonging to the
                    family
                    Turdidae, an unfortunate name if you ask me, the American Robin is related to other thrushes,
                    such
                    as the Hermit or Wood Thrush. The American Robin is one of the most famous birds in the North
                    American continent due to its unique appearance and population boom in the spring. Seen as a
                    spring
                    bird in pop culture due to this behvaior, the American Robin is usually welcomed on lawns to
                    pluck
                    the early worm, and its distinct red chest and black feathers are always a delight to see.</p>

                <p>American Robin songs sound like an ongoing escalator, just when you think the note is high
                    enough,
                    the robin finds a way to go even higher. This birdsong is a staple on the East Coast and in the
                    city, you might've heard it without even knowing it come from the robin!</p>
