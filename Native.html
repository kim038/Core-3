            <div class="description">The Gray Catbird is a member of the family Mimidae, and can be commonly mistaken
                for the Dark-Eyed Junco, another gray bird found in the city. However, the Gray Catbird is distinctly
                larger and has a dark beak and legs, with a black cap. It received its name due to its distinctly harsh
                call, which sounds like the meow of a cat. The Mimidae family also comprises of the Mockingbird and
                Thrashers, known for their mimicking abilities of other birds and even animals.</div>
